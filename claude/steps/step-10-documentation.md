# Generation Prompt: Step 10 — User Documentation

## Input

Read these specification files before generating:

1. `[FILE: F08-axioms.md]` — Foundational axioms (why OpenJunto exists, what it solves)
2. `[FILE: F16-architecture.md]` — System architecture (installed layout, activation mechanism, data flow)
3. `[FILE: D08-core-protocol.md]` — Triage model, execution tiers, quality gates
4. All other spec files (03-10) for comprehensive understanding

**Also read the actual OpenJunto source files** for reference:
- `/path/to/junto/README.md` — Project overview and quickstart
- `/path/to/junto/WHY.md` — Problem statement, how OpenJunto works, honest tradeoffs

## Task

Generate three user-facing documentation files:

1. **README.md** — Project overview, quickstart, architecture summary
2. **WHY.md** — Problem statement, how OpenJunto works, honest tradeoffs
3. **docs/onboarding.md** — First 10 minutes after installation

**Locations**:
- `/path/to/junto-project/README.md`
- `/path/to/junto-project/WHY.md`
- `/path/to/junto-project/docs/onboarding.md`

## 1. README.md

**Purpose**: First file users read. Quick overview, installation, and usage examples.

### Structure

1. **One-line summary** — "A Claude Code configuration that transforms the AI into a coordinated team of 16 expert sub-agents with structured peer review."

2. **Quickstart** — Plugin-host-mediated install (no build step, no `make install`). Match the live `oj-claude/README.md` Quickstart section:
   - **Primary path** (marketplace install from inside a Claude Code session):
     ```
     /plugin marketplace add openjunto/oj-claude
     /plugin install oj@openjunto
     ```
     Then "start a new Claude Code session (restart, or `/clear`) to load the plugin" — use this POST-PR#3 wording. Do NOT emit `/reload-plugins` as the post-install action (the `SessionStart` hook does not re-fire on `/reload-plugins`, so the banner would not appear and the manager protocol would not be re-injected).
   - **Local-iteration variant** (for working on the plugin without installing):
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/openjunto/oj-claude.git
     claude --plugin-dir ./oj-claude
     ```

3. **Usage** — Show how to put OpenJunto to work: the manager protocol loads at session start; the user invokes a coordinated cycle with `/oj:cycle <task>` (or `/oj:run-task` for a backlog item). Examples:
   - "/oj:cycle I'm adding rate limiting to the public REST API of our Node/Express auth service. Expected ~10,000 requests per minute, with one Redis instance available. What should I think about before implementing?"
   - "/oj:cycle Fix the flaky test in auth_service_test.go."
   - "/oj:cycle Evaluate whether we should migrate from REST to gRPC for internal services."

   Explain that the Manager handles triage, expert selection, peer review, and quality gates, and that the user does not name experts — the Manager selects them.

4. **What's Included** — Brief list of components:
   - 16 expert agents (link to `agents/`)
   - Templates (link to `templates/`)
   - Complexity triage (Simple/Moderate/Complex tiers)
   - Peer review workflow
   - Circuit breakers

5. **How It Works** — Four-step flow:
   1. Triage — Incoming requests scored against 4 criteria
   2. Delegation — Manager spawns domain experts
   3. Review — Peer experts validate work
   4. Synthesis — Manager consolidates findings

6. **Advanced: Backlog Sprint** — Explain `/run-task` command for projects with `.claude/BACKLOG.md`

7. **Directory Structure** — Show the plugin tree (`agents/`, `templates/`, `skills/`, `reference/`, `CONDUCTOR.md` at plugin root) and the `.claude/` per-project layout (`.claude/BACKLOG.md`, `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/state/`, `.claude/artifacts/`).

8. **Documentation Links** — Link to WHY.md and onboarding.md

### Key Requirements

- Keep it short (~80 lines max)
- Focus on getting started, not internals
- Examples should be concrete and recognizable
- Link to deeper docs (WHY.md, onboarding.md) for details

## 2. WHY.md

**Purpose**: Explain what problem OpenJunto solves, how it works, and honest tradeoffs. This is for people deciding whether to adopt OpenJunto.

### Structure

1. **The Problem** (from spec F08-axioms.md, Axiom 3):
   - Single-agent blind spots — Claude jumps to implementation without considering security, operational burden, failure modes
   - "Just prompt better" does not scale — Cannot hold 16 expert perspectives in your head
   - Context windows are the hard ceiling — Dilution across all roles

   **Result**: Code that works on happy path, but misses distributed bypass vectors, cache poisoning edge cases, thundering herds.

2. **How OpenJunto Works**:
   - Manager agent triages requests and selects domain experts
   - Domain experts analyze and build
   - Different expert reviews the work adversarially
   - Three tiers (Simple/Moderate/Complex) proportional to risk

   **Key mechanics**:
   - 16 domain experts (list roles)
   - Mandatory stakeholder perspectives (Product + Tech minimum)
   - STRONGEST OBJECTION required in every handback
   - Pre-mortem: "Imagine this shipped and failed. What went wrong?"
   - Circuit breaker: auto-escalates after 3 revision cycles

3. **What This Actually Looks Like** — Concrete example: adding rate limiting to an API

   **Without OpenJunto**: Working implementation, but misses:
   - Distributed bypass (attackers rotating IPs)
   - Cache poisoning (manipulating rate limit counters)
   - Thundering herd (simultaneous retries on window reset)
   - Storage cost at scale (per-user counter overhead)
   - Degradation behavior (rate limiter's backing store goes down)
   - Observability (no metrics on limit hit rates)

   **With OpenJunto**: Manager triages as Moderate, selects Security + DevOps + Software Engineer stakeholders. Each analyzes from their perspective, implementation incorporates findings, Distinguished Engineer conducts adversarial review.

4. **Honest Tradeoffs** — Table format (from junto/WHY.md):

   | Tradeoff | Reality |
   |----------|---------|
   | Token cost | 2-5x more tokens than baseline Claude |
   | Wall-clock time | Moderate tasks take minutes, not seconds |
   | Learning curve | ~1 week to internalize triage model |
   | Process discipline | Must respond to triage questions, approve stakeholder selections |
   | Over-processing risk | Simple tasks can get over-triaged if you don't push back |
   | Verbosity | Expert handbacks are structured and explicit (more text to read) |

   **When OpenJunto is NOT worth it**:
   - Quick one-off questions
   - Trivial fixes (typos, import ordering)
   - Rapid prototyping
   - Tasks where you know exactly what you want

   **When OpenJunto IS worth it**:
   - Security reviews
   - Architectural decisions
   - Cross-system changes
   - Compliance-sensitive work
   - Anything where "looks good to me" is not good enough

5. **Try It** — Installation command + first task to try:
   - "Review this pull request for security issues and operational readiness."
   - Point it at a real design problem and compare to single-agent Claude

### Key Requirements

- Be honest about costs (token overhead, wall-clock time, learning curve)
- Use concrete examples (rate limiting scenario)
- Do not oversell — "slower but catches the thing that would have cost you a week of incident response"
- Table format for tradeoffs (clear, scannable)

## 3. docs/onboarding.md

**Purpose**: Guide for new users in their first 10 minutes after installation.

### Structure

1. **Confirm Installation** — Check version banner:
   ```bash
   claude
   # Should print on stderr: OpenJunto v{version} active — OpenJunto coordination system
   ```
   The banner is emitted by the `SessionStart` hook. It appears on **session start** (startup, resume, `/clear`, compaction) — NOT on `/reload-plugins` or `/plugin reload` (plugin reload refreshes skills/agents/hooks in-process but does not re-fire `SessionStart`). After installing or reloading the plugin, start a new session (or `/clear`) to see the banner. `{version}` is read from the plugin package's `VERSION` file.

2. **Your First Task** — Start with something where multi-perspective review adds obvious value. The example MUST be prefixed with `/oj:cycle ` (the explicit-invocation activation model — manager triage engages only on coordinated-cycle command invocations, not free-form messages):
   - `/oj:cycle I'm adding rate limiting to the public REST API of our Node/Express auth service. Expected ~10,000 requests per minute, with one Redis instance available. What should I think about before implementing?`
   - Observe: Manager triages, spawns Security Engineer and Distinguished Engineer, synthesizes findings

3. **Understanding Triage** — The system scores requests against 4 criteria:
   1. Spans multiple technical domains?
   2. Regulatory or compliance implications?
   3. Could impact production stability?
   4. Significant cost or resource commitment?

   **Scoring**: 0-1 = Simple, 2-3 = Moderate, 4 = Complex

   **You can override triage** — If Manager over-triages a simple task, push back: "This is a typo fix, just do it."

4. **Stakeholder Selection** — Every task gets Product + Tech minimum. Domain signals add more:
   - Security/compliance → Security Engineer
   - Data modeling → Data Architect
   - Infrastructure/CI/CD → DevOps Engineer
   - ML systems → ML Engineer

5. **Reading Expert Handbacks** — Structure:
   - **STATUS**: Complete / Needs Iteration / Blocked / Escalate
   - **CONFIDENCE**: High / Medium / Low
   - **STRONGEST OBJECTION**: Best argument against the recommendation
   - **FALSIFIER**: Empirical condition that breaks it in production

   Low confidence is valuable signal, not failure.

6. **Common Mistakes**:
   - Over-accepting triage — Don't let Manager over-process simple tasks
   - Ignoring STRONGEST OBJECTION — It's not boilerplate, it's the best counterargument
   - Expecting instant results — Moderate tasks take minutes; process overhead is real

7. **Advanced: Backlog Sprint** — If your project has `.claude/BACKLOG.md`:
   ```bash
   claude '/run-task'
   ```
   Manager picks next item, delegates to experts, enforces peer review, marks done.

8. **Next Steps**:
   - Read WHY.md for tradeoffs
   - Read CONDUCTOR.md for full manager protocol
   - Try `/run-task` on a project with backlog
   - Check `agents/index.md` for expert roster

### Key Requirements

- Walk through first 10 minutes chronologically
- Show expected output at each step
- Include "Common Mistakes" section (prevents early frustration)
- Link to deeper docs (WHY.md, CLAUDE.md) for next level

## Verification

After generating all three files, verify:

1. **README.md**:
   - Installation is plugin-host-mediated. **Negative**: README MUST NOT contain `make install`. **Positive**: README Quickstart MUST contain BOTH `/plugin marketplace add openjunto/oj-claude` AND `/plugin install oj@openjunto` (the marketplace-install flow shipped in PR #3). **Negative**: README MUST NOT instruct the user to `/reload-plugins` after install — the correct post-install action is "start a new Claude Code session (restart, or `/clear`)".
   - **Positive**: README Usage examples MUST be prefixed with `/oj:cycle ` (the explicit-invocation activation model). At least one example MUST also mention `/oj:run-task` as the single-item alternative.
   - Usage examples are concrete (not abstract)
   - Directory structure shows the plugin tree (`agents/`, `templates/`, `skills/`, `reference/`, `CONDUCTOR.md` at plugin root) and the `.claude/` per-project layout
   - Links to WHY.md and onboarding.md

2. **WHY.md**:
   - Problem statement references single-agent blind spots (Axiom 3 from F08-axioms.md)
   - Concrete example (rate limiting scenario) shows what's missed without OpenJunto
   - Tradeoffs table is honest (token cost 2-5x, wall-clock time overhead)
   - "When OpenJunto is NOT worth it" section exists

3. **docs/onboarding.md**:
   - Confirms installation with version banner check
   - First task is concrete and shows triage in action
   - **Positive**: the "Your First Task" example MUST be prefixed with `/oj:cycle ` (e.g., `/oj:cycle I'm adding rate limiting to the public REST API of our Node/Express auth service. Expected ~10,000 requests per minute, with one Redis instance available. What should I think about before implementing?`) — matches the live `oj-claude/docs/onboarding.md`. A bare unprefixed example is a fidelity bug.
   - Triage model explained (4 criteria, 0-1/2-3/4 scoring)
   - Common mistakes section exists
   - Links to next steps (WHY.md, CLAUDE.md, agents/index.md)

## Dependencies

This step requires:
- **Prior steps**: 00-06 complete (all spec files exist for reference)
- **External tools**: None

**Next step**: None (documentation is the final step)
