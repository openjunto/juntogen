- [ ] Reads hook JSON from stdin
- [ ] Only processes `general-purpose` agents (skips Bash, Explore, Plan)
- [ ] Derives subagent transcript path from hook JSON
- [ ] Waits up to 500ms for transcript file to appear
- [ ] Reads first line of transcript (spawn prompt)

- [ ] Path traversal guard (rejects `..` and `/` in profile names)
- [ ] Loads `_preamble.md` + full profile (or compact fallback)
- [ ] Outputs hook response JSON with `additionalContext` field
- [ ] Graceful exit 0 on failures (jq missing, transcript unavailable, profile not found)

## settings.json

### Structure

- [ ] `model` field set to "opus"
- [ ] `attribution` object with empty `commit` and `pr` fields

### Environment Variables
- [ ] `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` (preferred; enables the Convene substrate. When unset, Complex tier degrades to the Convene→Consult fallback per Axiom 8 — the install is still valid, but adopters should be aware the Complex branch will exercise the fallback path rather than TeamCreate. `oj-helper agent-teams-check` reports availability.)
- [ ] `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_UNIFIED_READ_TOOL=1`
- [ ] `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_ADAPTIVE_THINKING=1`

### Permissions
- [ ] Allow list includes Read access to workspace and ~/.claude/ subdirectories
- [ ] Allow list includes Bash commands (git, cat, grep, ls, oj-helper, diagnostic tools)
- [ ] Deny list includes `rm -rf /*` and `git push --force`

### Hooks
- [ ] SessionStart hook calls `oj-helper conductor-inject`, which injects CONDUCTOR.md as `additionalContext` (stdout JSON) AND prints the version banner to stderr (banner is stderr-only; version read from plugin `VERSION`, not `.oj-version`)
- [ ] SessionStart hook timeout: 5 seconds
- [ ] SubagentStart hook calls `oj-helper inject-profile`
- [ ] SubagentStart hook matcher: "general-purpose"
- [ ] SubagentStart hook timeout: 5 seconds

## Common Generation Failures (Anti-Patterns to Check)

### Generic Profiles
- [ ] Check that 3 profiles have differentiated red flags (not all saying the same things)
- [ ] Check that adversarial language differs by domain (Security ≠ DevOps ≠ SRE)

### Format Drift
- [ ] PERSPECTIVE block format consistent across CLAUDE.md, preamble, workflow-stages
- [ ] HANDBACK field names identical in all references
- [ ] Quality gate counts match everywhere (CLAUDE.md, quality-framework, worked-examples)

### Missing Adversarial Framing
- [ ] Check 3 profiles: "When Supporting" section includes "actively probe" language
- [ ] Check adversarial review sections: must say "Find the single most important problem"
- [ ] STRONGEST OBJECTION fields: check that 2-3 example handbacks have genuine objections (not weak)

### TENSION Items
- [ ] Check workflow-stages: TENSION items described as protected (cannot be removed)
- [ ] Check stakeholder-guide: TENSION classification type present
